Hey everyone! I started my journey as a software developer when I first came to [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). Here, I have been studying computer science for three years.

I am most experienced in full stack web development, exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

I am also skilled in business and entrepreneurship, having founded and operated a clothing design company that reclaimed and repurposed vintage clothing for modern applications.

In my free time, I love to play chess, spend time with friends, and watch Christopher Nolan movies.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
